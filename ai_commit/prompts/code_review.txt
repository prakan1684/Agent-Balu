   - Avoid writing sub-points or additional comments.

3. **Concise Feedback**:
   - Avoid verbose explanations. Provide only what is necessary to understand the issue and fix it.

4. **No Code Examples**:
   - Do not include any code snippets in your suggestions. Focus only on describing the issue and the fix.
